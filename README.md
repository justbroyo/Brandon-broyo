# Brandon-broyo

#Bryce was responsbible for adding the expenses, adding the feature that controls viewing the expenses as wel as adding he feature that filters the expenses.

#i was resposnsible to calclate the total expenses as well as delete the specific expenses.

#Throughout the proect, me and Bryce had the most difficulty in commiting changes in GitHub. This was harder for us to navigate due to the fact that GitHub is not something that we are familiar with. I think that collaborative coding is kind of hard to do because ultimaely, it was hard to find a time where both of us could work on the project. I also think that calculating and deleting the expenses was a bit hard to make.
